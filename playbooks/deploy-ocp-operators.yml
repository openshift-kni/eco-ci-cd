# This playbook is not officially supported and comes with no guarantees.
# Use it at your own risk. Ensure you test thoroughly in your environment
# before deploying to production.

## Overview:
# This Ansible playbook automates the deployment of multiple OpenShift operators using
# the **Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)**. It includes tasks to install necessary dependencies,
# configure variables, and deploy the specified operators into the designated namespaces.

## Prerequisites:
# - Ansible 2.9+ installed on the control node.
# - Ansible control node configured with necessary permissions.
# - SSH Access to bastion hosts.
# - ocp version of link to operator release version
# - pre-configured hosts_vars and grup_vars directories
# - installed openshift cluster
# - KUBECONFIG file

## Roles Requirements
# The playbook uses role:
# - redhatci.ocp.catalog_source
# - redhatci.ocp.catalog_source

## Usage:
# - Ensure all required variables are defined in the inventory or host_vars/group_vars.
# - Execute the playbook using Ansible's command-line tool:
#
# ansible-playbook ./playbooks/deploy-ocp-operators.yaml -i ./inventories/ocp-deployment/deploy-ocp-operators.yml \
# --extra-vars 'kubeconfig="/path/to/kubeconfig" \
# version="4.16" operators=[
# {"name":"sriov-network-operator","catalog":"redhat-operators","nsname":"openshift-sriov-network-operator","deploy_default_config":"true"},\
# {"name":"metallb-operator","catalog":"redhat-operators","nsname":"metallb-system","channel":"stable","og_spec":{},deploy_default_config: "true"}]
#
# Notes:
# - This playbook assumes the OCP cluster and bastion hosts are pre-installed and ready.
# - Test in a non-production environment before deploying.
